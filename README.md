# Medium.com Unlimited Reading User Script

This user script enables unlimited reading on Medium.com by detecting paywall elements and redirecting to an alternative service for unrestricted access.

## Features

- **Automatic Paywall Detection:** Identifies Medium's paywall indicators.
- **Seamless Redirection:** Redirects to [freedium.cfd](https://freedium.cfd/) for full article access.
- **Non-Intrusive Operation:** Runs in the background without user intervention.

## Installation

1. **Install a User Script Manager:**
   - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
   - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)

2. **Add the User Script:**
   - Click on the following link to install the script: [Medium.com Unlimited Reading](#)

## How It Works

Upon loading a Medium article, the script checks for paywall elements. If detected, it redirects the browser to [freedium.cfd](https://freedium.cfd/), which provides the full article without restrictions.

## Disclaimer

Bypassing paywalls may violate Medium's terms of service. Consider supporting content creators through subscriptions.
